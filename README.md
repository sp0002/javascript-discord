Running javascript on discord (bot)
**DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR COMPUTER! NOT SECURE!**

## What does this do?
This creates a bot that you can send messages to run javascript.

## Is it good?
It works, but it is not the best solution. This is just a wacky way to make things work. It may break in some places.

## How to use it?
It runs on node.js
You can run it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Is it dangerous?
Very. Run only on an isolated environment such as a VPS or on another platform. Do not store any other sensitive information on the system running this code.
